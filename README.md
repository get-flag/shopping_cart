# shopping_cart

The idea is to get started with development, create a shopping cart that has Inventory, Customers, Product, Orders etc.

Learn OOPS concepts well, get a good hang of it, learn good programming practices, add unit tests

Add Database support on the backend for the data to persist in a deployed environment

Extend it to backend service using Flask, use redis to cache

Dockerize the application

Write regression tests against it

Integrate it with CI/CD post every merge
